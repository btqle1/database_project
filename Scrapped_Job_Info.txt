Job Title: Director of Development
Company Title: Ronald McDonald House Charities of South Louisiana




Ronald McDonald House Charities of South Louisiana
Director of Development Position Description
ABOUT US
Ronald McDonald House Charities® of South Louisiana (RMHC-SLA)’s mission is to provide a “home- away-from-home” to families of seriously ill or injured children and programs that give comfort, compassion and care to children and their families. In 2019, its Ronald McDonald House New Orleans was just such a home to more than 435 families who traveled many miles to receive specialized medical care for their child at nearby medical facilities.
At Ronald McDonald House they found a free place to stay, meals to eat, transportation if needed, and a built- in support system where families help one other. Headquartered in New Orleans, RMHC-SLA has been keeping families with sick children close together and near to the care and resources they need since 1983.
As we look to our future, we want to increase the impact we’re making throughout south Louisiana. As part of this vision, we are expanding and relocating from our current home in Mid-City New Orleans to a new one on Children’s Hospital campus that will allow us to reach more families with expanded programming and community resources available.
